## About Me


<img src="J_Schafer2_067_CFStaff.jpg" alt="ME!" width="300" height="200">


I am currently working at Lawrence Livermore National Lab focusing on the modeling and optimization of power systems. Originally from Montana, I have a specific interest in decarbonization / renewable energy projects in the Western US. My work primarily is focused on the control and automation of differing renewable energy dependent systems realting but not limited to nuclear, microgrids, battery energy storage and Vehicle-to-grid applications.

## Projects
### Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Scheduling using Reinforcement Learning
This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize V2G scheduling within a microgrid. The key focus is on leveraging the battery storage of electric vehicles (EVs) to balance the grid's energy supply and demand effectively. We employ two primary RL techniques: Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and Actor-Critic models, to develop and compare different strategies for energy management.

### Control of Cogeneration in Small Modular Reactors to Enable Load Following
Comparing Model Predictive Control versus PI control to manipulate the relative generation of electricity/heat in a nuclear cogeneration facility in order to effectively load follow in a highly renewable penetrated microgrid setting.

### Multiperiod Robust Optimal Power Flow and Model Predictive Control
Evaluates two methods for optimal power flow in a microgrid using the IEEE 39-bus systemâ€”Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Robust Optimization. It highlights how MPC adapts to real-time data and uncertainties better than Robust Optimization, effectively balancing energy supply from renewables with grid demands. The study demonstrates MPC's superior performance in optimizing power flows and minimizing reliance on diesel generation, paving the way for more sustainable energy management strategies."

### EV Charging Behavior Analysis and Identification for V2G Utilization
Analyzing the EV charging behavior of users in LA to identify different groups of "like" charging behaviors in order to inform V2G decision making.

Outside of my professional aspirations, there is nothing better than skiing, biking and trucks!
