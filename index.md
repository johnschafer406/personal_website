## About Me

<img src="J_Schafer2_067_CFStaff.jpg" alt="John Schafer" width="300" height="200">

I'm an energy systems engineer who turns ambitious ideas into reality. From founding SOLV's CHIL testing lab to developing next-gen control systems, I thrive at the intersection of deep technical work and entrepreneurial execution. I don't just solve problems - I build the programs, teams, and systems that solve them at scale. 

Originally from Montana, I focus on **decarbonization and renewable energy projects** in the Western US. My work centers on the control and automation of renewable energy systems including nuclear, microgrids, battery energy storage, and vehicle-to-grid applications.

Currently exploring opportunities in **power systems controls** and **energy system optimization**.

## Experience

**Test and Simulation Engineer** | *SOLV Energy* | 2024-Present  
Pioneered SOLV's CHIL test lab from platform selection through full software Factory Acceptance Tests. High-fidelity modeling of PV and BESS sites using PSS/E and PSCAD for real-time control via SEL RTAC systems.

**Critical Infrastructure Analyst** | *Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory* | Summer 2024  
Graduate internship in the Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Summer Institute. Developed Python/MATLAB solutions to increase power system infrastructure resiliency within national security contexts.

**Solutions Consultant** | *commonFont* | 2021-2022  
Led technical implementation of SaaS platforms and BI tools for enterprise clients using JavaScript, HTML, and AWS. Headed dynamic team consulting on machine learning and data-driven business strategies.

## Education

**University of California, Berkeley** | *2024*  
Master of Science in Systems Engineering, Civil & Environmental Engineering, GPA: 3.8  

**Montana State University, Honors College** | *2021*  
Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics, GPA: 4.00  
Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, GPA: 3.98  

## Technical Skills
